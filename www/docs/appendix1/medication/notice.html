		<p>Refer to the pharmaceutical manufacturer's literature for full prescribing information. The below tables are commonly prescribed medications for a number of conditions discussed in this toolkit. The decision to utilize one medication over another should be based on the individual patient, the symptom complaints, and the basic features and potential side effects of the medication in question. Some of the medications listed should be prescribed only with the specialty consultation depending on patient complexity and the condition being treated. If in doubt, consult with the appropriate specialty clinic. Unless specifically noted as IM dosing, the doses listed are for oral dosing.</p>
