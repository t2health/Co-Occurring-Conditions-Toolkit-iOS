<h3>Brand names: Depade, ReVia</h3>
<hr>

					<h3>Adult Starting Dose (Max Per Day)</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>Specialty consultation advised </li>
						<li>Extended dosing intervals, using equivalent weekly doses, may be used with supervised administration</li>
					</ul>
<hr>
					<h3>Advantages</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>Only the oral formulation of naltrexone is currently FDA-approved for maintenance therapy of Opioid dependence </li> 
						<li>Side effects, if any, tend to occur early in treatment and can typically resolve within 1-2 weeks after dosage adjustment </li> 
						<li>Take with food to minimize nausea especially during the first week</li> 
					</ul>
<hr>
					<h3>Disadvantages</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>Contraindications include acute hepatitis or liver failure, current physiological dependence on Opioids with use within past 7 days, ongoing acute Opioid withdrawal or failed naloxone challenge test, receiving Opioid agonists or positive urine Opioid screen</li> 
						<li>Common Adverse Effects: nausea </li>
						<li>No Opioid agonist effects </li>
						<li>Patients continue to have cravings and may thereby not be motivated to maintain adherence to the medication regimen </li>
						<li>Patients must be fully withdrawn for up to 7-10 days before beginning naltrexone treatment </li>
						<li>Precautions include active liver disease, severe hepatic dysfunction and severe renal failure </li>
						<li>Naltrexone is unpopular with many Opioid dependent patients since maintenance therapy requires complete abstinence from Opioids; Treatment dropouts are common</li>	
					</ul>
<hr>
					<h3>Pregnancy Category</h3>	
					<ul>
							<li>Risk cannot be ruled out, but potential benefits may justify potential risk</li>	
					</ul>
<hr>
					<h3>Safety Margin</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>Limited clinical experience with over dosage in humans </li>
						<li>Drug Interactions include: Opioidcontaining medications, including over-thecounter (OTC) preparations, thioridazine, oral hypoglycemic and Antiretrovirals </li>
						<li>Very large doses of Opioids may overcome the effects of naltrexone and lead to serious injury, coma, or death </li>
						<li>Small doses of Opioids, such as in Analgesic, Antidiarrheal, or Antitussive drugs, may be blocked by Naltrexone and fail to produce a therapeutic effect</li>
						
					</ul>
<hr>
					<h3>Efficacy</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>FDA approved for use in alcohol dependency</li>	
					</ul>

					<h3>Warnings for Naltrexone</h3>	
					<p><b>Monitoring, Referrals and Warnings:</b> Specialty consultation advised. Baseline evaluation include: naloxone challenge test, transaminase levels and urine toxicology. Therapy is most effective when the patient is engaged in addiction-focused counseling with monitored administration. Repeat transaminase levels monthly for the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter. Discontinue or reduce naltrexone if transaminase levels rise significantly. Warn patient that if signs and symptoms of acute hepatitis occur, discontinue naltrexone and contact their provider immediately.</p>
					<p>Warn patients that attempts to overcome Opioid blockade could lead to fatal overdose. Monitor closely for suicidal thoughts and depression.</p>
  	<p><b>Methadone Black Box Warning:</b> Naltrexone has the capacity to cause hepatocellular injury when given in excessive doses. Patients should be warned of the risk of hepatic injury and advised to stop the use of naltrexone and seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of acute hepatitis.</p>
