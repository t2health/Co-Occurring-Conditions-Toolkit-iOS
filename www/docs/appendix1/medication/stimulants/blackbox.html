    <p><b>Methylphenidate Black Box Warning:</b> Give Methylphenidate cautiously to emotionally unstable patients such as those with a history of drug dependence or alcoholism since they may increase their dosage on their own initiative. Potential for dependency exists, avoid abrupt discontinuance in patients who have received these for long periods of time. Carefully supervise the patient during withdrawal because severe depression along with chronic over activity can be unmasked. </p>
