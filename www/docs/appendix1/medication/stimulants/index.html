    	<p>The psychostimulants may have a role as augmentation agents in the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) under specialty consultation, although the evidence is stronger in support of other augmentation agents. Psychostimulants should not be prescribed for patients with uncontrolled hypertension or cardiovascular disease. Psychostimulants are best avoided in patients with a co-morbid anxiety or for those in whom anxiety is a significant symptom of their depression. All psychostimulants are Schedule II drugs with the exception of modafanil which is Schedule IV.</p>
