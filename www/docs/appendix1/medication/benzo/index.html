    	 	<p>Use with caution in the elderly and patients with impaired liver function, impaired renal function, respiratory disease and depression. Reduce the dosage in the elderly. Risk of abuse in patients with history of substance abuse. Pharmacotherapy for PTSD with clonazepam, diazepam or lorazepam should be carefully considered due to their sedating and addictive qualities. Avoid use of Benzodiazepine pharmacotherapy in mTBI if at all possible as it contributes to confusion. If used in mTBI, therapy should be carefully considered due to their sedating and addictive qualities. The dose of narcotics should be decreased by 1/3 when diazepam is added.</p> 
    	<p>Benzodiazepines are the treatment of choice for alcohol withdrawal. For inpatient treatment of alcohol withdrawal, use Benzodiazepines over non-Benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics because of documented efficacy, and a greater margin of safety. Benzodiazepines are the drug of choice in this setting, given adequate monitoring, because they reduce withdrawal severity, incidence of delirium, and seizures. All Benzodiazepines appear to be effective, but agents without active metabolites such as lorazepam may be preferred in patients with liver impairment. Dose and withdrawal scales should be individualized for each patient. Geriatric patients should start with lower doses of Benzodiazepines than younger adults.</p>     </div>
