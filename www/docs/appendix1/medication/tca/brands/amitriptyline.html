					<ul>
						<li>Initial adult dose = 50mg QHS up to TID </li>
						<li>Max adult dose/day = 300mg </li>
						<li>Initial geriatric dose = 10- 25mg Qhs</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Advantages</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>May use in mTBI patients for headache or for sleep </li>
						<li>Generic</li>

					<h3>Disadvantages</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li><b>Contraindications include acute recovery phase following MI</b> </li>
						<li>Adverse Side Effects: cardiovascular (orthostatic hypotension, syncope, tachycardia, arrhythmias), anticholinergic (constipation, dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention, increased intraocular pressure), sedation, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and decreased seizure threshold</li> 
						<li>Amitriptyline and doxepin have a higher probability of weight gain than other TCAs </li>
						<li>Higher doses may be required for smokers taking Amitriptyline due to increased metabolism</li>
					</ul>
<hr>
					<h3>Pregnancy Category</h3>	
					<ul>
							<li>Risk cannot be ruled out, but potential benefits may justify potential risk</li>	
					</ul>
<hr>
					<h3>Safety Margin for TCAs</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>Lethal in OD </li>
						<li>Contraindicated with MAOIs within past 14 days of therapy </li>
						<li>Bupropion, Haloperidol and SSRIs may increase the TCA's level which may increase pharmacologic and adverse effects. Wait 5 weeks after discontinuing fluoxetine before starting a TCA</li> 
						<li>Quinolones (Gatifloxacin, Moxifloxacin) if used with TCA's may cause QT prolongation and may increase the risk of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias </li>
						<li>Quinolones (Grepafloxacin, Sparfloxacin) if used with TCAs have an increased risk of lifethreatening arrhythmias including torsades de pointes</li>
						<li>Contraindicated use with desipramine and thioridazine </li>
						<li>Slow system clearance</li>
						<li>Avoid concomitant use with clonidine, levodopa, Quinolones, guanethidine, alcohol, valerian, st. john's wort, kava kava, nilotinib, sibutramine, tetrabenazine, thioridazine and ziprasidone</li>

					<h3>Efficacy for TCAs</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>Response rate = mild depression 4-8 weeks; Moderate depression = 8-12 week; Severe depression = augmentative strategies, concurrent administration of adjuncts (referral to specialist)</li>
						<li>Recommended as monotherapy as secondline therapy in PTSD </li>
						<li>Amitriptyline has fair documentation for efficacy in use for fibromyalgia </li>
						<li>Good evidence exists from multiple well-designed clinical trials that amitriptyline has medium to high efficacy in the prevention of migraines</li>	
						<li>Doses typically are lower for migraine treatment than for depression treatment </li>
						<li>Nortriptyline has been used in clinical studies for smoking cessation</li>
						<li>TCAs are considered to be the drug of choice by some clinicians for symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain (postherpetic neuralgia)</li> 
						<li>Doxepin is approved for use in anxiety associated with alcoholism</li>
