    <p><i>Methadone:</i> Careful monitoring in patients with a history of cardiac conduction abnormalities, on medications affecting cardiac conduction, and other situations suggesting an increased risk of dysrhythmia. Obtain an ECG before initiation of methadone, after 30 days and yearly. Perform an ECG if the dose exceeds 100mg/day or if the patient has unexplained syncope or seizures. Monitor methadone patients extra carefully during initiation, conversions to and from other Opioids and dose titration.</p> 
    <p><i>Fentanyl:</i> Monitor patients for adverse effects and modify dosage as necessary if the patient has a fever.</p>
    <p><i>Opioids:</i> Monitor patient for constipation at every office visit. Consider monitoring bone density in patients at risk for osteoporosis. Refer to a more structured program for patients with substance abuse history, psychiatric comorbidity and persistent or troublesome aberrant behavior. Refer to a Substance Use Disorder (SUD) specialty for redirecting addiction behaviors and continued Opioid therapy. Refer patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders to appropriate mental health providers. Perform urine drug testing in patients with a history of SUD as an adjunctive tool at regular intervals.</p>
