    	<p>May develop tolerance within days or need a dose increase. Taper Opioids when discontinuing. Taper by 20-50% per week for patients who are not addicted. The longer the patient has been on the Opioids, the slower the taper should be. Consider using adjuvant agents such as Antidepressants to manage irritability, sleep disturbances or Anticonvulsants for neuropathic pain. Do not treat withdrawal symptoms with Opioids or Benzodiazepines after discontinuing Opioids. Consider using clonidine 0.1mg two to three times daily to control any withdrawal symptoms if there are no contraindications. Supplemental medications will often be required as clonidine will not address all withdrawal symptoms. Monitor patient safety and comfort during the initial phase of Opioid abstinence.</p>
    	<p>Opioid therapy should be tapered off and discontinued if the medication fails to show partial analgesia with incremental dose titration, trials with different agents provide inadequate analgesia, there is other evidence that the pain may not be Opioid responsive, real or potential harms outweigh real or potential benefits, or upon patient request. Consider decreasing the Opioid dose when pain level decreases in stable patients.</p> 
    	<p>Adverse effects can be minimized through the use of low starting doses, slower titration rates, prophylactic and symptomatic treatments and specific patient education provided at initiation of therapy. If side effects do occur, then recommend modifying the dose or rotating the Opioid agent to minimize adverse effects.</p> 
    	<p>Initiate a bowel regimen at the start of Opioid therapy. Initial bowel regimens should contain a stimulant laxative and a stool softener. Do not use a bulk forming agent as they may cause intestinal obstruction. For nausea and vomiting, consider prophylactic Antiemetic therapy; Add or increase non-Opioid adjuvants; If analgesia is satisfactory, decrease Opioid dose by 25%. For sedation: determine whether sedation is due to the Opioid; Eliminate nonessential CNS depressants; If analgesia is satisfactory, reduce Opioid dose by 10-15%; Add or increase non-Opioid or non-sedating adjuvant for additional pain relief so that the Opioid can be reduced; Add stimulant drug during the day such as Caffeine, or change the Opioid.</p> 
    	<p>Use caution in patients with head injury, hypothyroidism, CNS depression, elderly, renal, hepatic and debilitated patients. Use caution since the Opioids may induce or aggravate seizures.</p>
