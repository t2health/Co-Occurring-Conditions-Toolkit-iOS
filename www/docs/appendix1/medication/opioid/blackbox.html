    <p><b>Black Box Warning:</b> Black box warnings exist for morphine, fentanyl patches, oxycodone, oxymorphone and methadone. See prescribing information for full list of warnings.</p>   	    	
    <p><i>Morphine 8-12 hour Extended Release tablets:</i> Swallow tablets whole; taking broken, chewed, dissolved, or crushed tablets leads to rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose.</p>
    <p><i>Morphine 24-hour Extended Release capsules:</i> Do not chew, crush, or dissolve due to risk of rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose. Avinza (brand name) â€“ Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages or medications containing alcohol; may result in rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of morphine.</p> 
    <p><i>Fentanyl Patches:</i> Use only in patients who are already receiving Opioid therapy, have demonstrated Opioid tolerance, and require a total daily dose at least equivalent to fentanyl transdermal system 25 mcg/hour. Use in non-Opioid tolerant patients may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Serious or life-threatening hypoventilation may occur, even in Opioid-tolerant patients, during the initial application period. Concomitant use with CYP 3A4 inhibitors may increase plasma concentrations, increase or prolong adverse drug effects, and cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Using damaged or cut fentanyl transdermal patches can lead to rapid release of fentanyl and absorption of a potentially fatal dose. Potential for temperaturedependent increases in fentanyl release, resulting in possible overdose and death.</p> 
    <p><i>Oxycodone 12-hour Controlled Release tablets:</i> Swallow whole; rapid release if broken, chewed, or crushed may lead to absorption of a potentially fatal dose.</p>
    <p><i>Oxymorphone 12-hour Extended Release tablets:</i> Swallow whole; taking broken, chewed, dissolved, or crushed tablets may lead to rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxymorphone. Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages or medications containing alcohol; may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of oxymorphone.</p>
    <p><i>Methadone:</i> Deaths reported during initiation of methadone for Opioid dependence; some cases appear related to too-rapid titration without appreciation for accumulation of methadone over time. Strongly caution patients against self-medicating with CNS depressants during initiation of methadone. Peak respiratory effects typically occur later and persist longer than peak analgesic effects, particularly in the early dosing period; can contribute to iatrogenic overdose. QTc interval prolongation and serious arrhythmia (torsades de pointes) observed; more common in patients being treated for pain with large, multiple daily doses.</p>
