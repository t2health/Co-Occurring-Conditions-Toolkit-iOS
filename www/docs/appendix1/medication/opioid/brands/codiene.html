			<p>Used alone or in combination with Aspirin (ASA) or Acetaminophen (APAP); (Tylenol with Codeine)</p>
<hr>
					<h3>Adult Starting Dose (Max Per Day)</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>Initial dose = 30mg q 4 to 6 hours. </li>
						<li>Titration: Increase dose as needed and tolerated to a maximum of 360mg/day of codeine (4000mg/ day maximum of APAP; 2000mg/day maximum of APAP in chronic alcoholics)</li> 
						<li>Ceiling effect occurs at doses &gt; 60mg/dose</li>
					</ul>
<hr>
					<h3>Advantages</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>Codeine in combination with APAP or ASA is a more effective Analgesic than codeine alone since codeine alone is a weak analgesic</li> 
					</ul> 
<hr>
					<h3>Disadvantages</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>Contraindications include respiratory depression, acute or severe bronchial asthma, hypercarbia and paralytic ileus </li>
						<li>May cause elevated plasma amylase and lipase due to spasm of sphincter of Oddi</li> 
					</ul>
<hr>
					<h3>Pregnancy Category</h3>	
					<ul>
							<li>Risk cannot be ruled out, but potential benefits may justify potential risk</li>	
					</ul>
<hr>
					<h3>Safety Margin</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>Ultrarapid CYP2D6 metabolizers may convert codeine into morphine more rapidly and completely than others, resulting in higher than expected serum morphine levels and possible overdose symptoms</li> 
						<li>Use extreme caution and frequent monitoring in patients receiving transdermal fentanyl and any CYP3A4 inhibitor</li>
						<li>Serious potential for overdose in the Opioid novice, use with caution and with gradual dose increase. Start with the lowest dose possible </li>
						<li>All Opioids are contraindicated in patients who have received MAOIs within 14 days </li>
						<li>Morphine has active metabolites (M3G and M6G) which may accumulate in renal impairment and contribute to toxic effects</li> 
						<li>Use extreme caution using Opioids in patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve </li>
						<li>Avinza: due to fumaric acid content, doses above 1600 mg may result in serious renal toxicity</li> 					
					</ul>
<hr>
					<h3>Efficacy</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>Long acting Opioids are effective for continuous, chronic pain </li>
						<li>Opioids are highly effective in pain management </li>
						<li>Methadone is FDA approved for the detoxification treatment of Opioid addiction; If used in detoxification, then it must be used as part of an FDA approved program</li>
