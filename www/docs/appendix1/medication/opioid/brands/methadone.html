			<h3>Brand names: Dolophine, Methadose</h3>
<hr>
					<h3>Adult Starting Dose (Max Per Day)</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>Initial dose = 2.5 to 10mg orally q 8 to 12 hours. </li> 
						<li>More frequent administration (q 6 hours) may be necessary during initiation to maintain analgesia. Use extreme caution to avoid over dosage due to long plasma half-life</li>  
						<li>Titration: Increments of 2.5mg q 8 hours may be made every 5 to 7 days </li> 
						<li><b>Start low and go slow</b></li> 
					</ul>
<hr>
					<h3>Advantages</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>Recommended firstor second-line long-acting agent, but prescribers of methadone should be thoroughly familiar with its complex pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties or consult a clinician with experience in dosing methadone</li> 
						<li>The only longacting Opioid available  as an oral solution </li>
						<li>Once a stable analgesic dose is reached, the dosing interval may be extended to q 8 to 12 hours or longer</li> 
					</ul> 
<hr>
					<h3>Disadvantages</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>Contraindications include any situation where Opioids are contraindicated, such as patients with respiratory depression (in the absence of resuscitative equipment or in unmonitored situations), acute bronchial asthma, hypercarbia and known or suspected paralytic ileus</li> 
						<li>May prolong QTc intervals on ECG; Risk of cardiac arrhythmias </li>
						<li>Discontinue or taper the methadone dose and consider an alternative therapy if the QTc &gt; 500ms </li>
						<li>Methadone should not be used as prn supplemental Opioid therapy </li>
						<li>Plasma half-life may be longer than the analgesic duration </li>
						<li>Delayed analgesia or toxicity may occur because of drug accumulation after repeated doses, e.g., on days 2 to 5; If patient has excessive sedation during this timeframe, consider temporarily holding dose(s), lowering the dose, and/or slowing the titration rate</li> 
					</ul>
<hr>
					<h3>Pregnancy Category</h3>	
					<ul>
							<li>No evidence of risk in humans</li>	
					</ul>
<hr>
					<h3>Safety Margin</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>Methadone has little cross-tolerance with other Opioids; Therefore, even patients with a high degree of Opioid tolerance may be at risk for overdose when switched to methadone</li> 
						<li>Avoid concomitant use of methadone with Benzodiazepines or TCAs with morphine due to respiratory depression</li>
						<li>Oxymorphone is contraindicated with alcohol</li>
						<li>Do not administer Opioid agonist/ antagonist Analgesics (pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol) or partial agonists (buprenorphine) to a patient who is receiving a course of therapy with a pure agonist Opioid Analgesic since it may precipitate withdrawal symptoms</li> 
						<li>Avoid concomitant use with valerian, st. john's wort and kava kava</li>
						<li>Ultrarapid CYP2D6 metabolizers may convert codeine into morphine more rapidly and completely than others, resulting in higher than expected serum morphine levels and possible overdose symptoms</li> 
						<li>Use extreme caution and frequent monitoring in patients receiving transdermal fentanyl and any CYP3A4 inhibitor</li>
						<li>Serious potential for overdose in the Opioid novice, use with caution and with gradual dose increase. Start with the lowest dose possible </li>
						<li>All Opioids are contraindicated in patients who have received MAOIs within 14 days </li>
						<li>Morphine has active metabolites (M3G and M6G) which may accumulate in renal impairment and contribute to toxic effects</li> 
						<li>Use extreme caution using Opioids in patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve </li>
						<li>Avinza: due to fumaric acid content, doses above 1600 mg may result in serious renal toxicity</li> 					
					</ul>
<hr>
					<h3>Efficacy</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>Long acting Opioids are effective for continuous, chronic pain </li>
						<li>Opioids are highly effective in pain management </li>
						<li>Methadone is FDA approved for the detoxification treatment of Opioid addiction; If used in detoxification, then it must be used as part of an FDA approved program</li>		
					</ul>
