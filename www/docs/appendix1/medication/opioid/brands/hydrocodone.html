					<ul>
						<li>Do not administer Opioid agonist/ antagonist Analgesics (pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol) or partial agonists (buprenorphine) to a patient who is receiving a course of therapy with a pure agonist Opioid Analgesic since it may precipitate withdrawal symptoms</li> 
						<li>Avoid concomitant use with valerian, st. john's wort and kava kava</li>
						<li>Ultrarapid CYP2D6 metabolizers may convert codeine into morphine more rapidly and completely than others, resulting in higher than expected serum morphine levels and possible overdose symptoms</li> 
						<li>Use extreme caution and frequent monitoring in patients receiving transdermal fentanyl and any CYP3A4 inhibitor</li>
						<li>Serious potential for overdose in the Opioid novice, use with caution and with gradual dose increase. Start with the lowest dose possible </li>
						<li>All Opioids are contraindicated in patients who have received MAOIs within 14 days </li>
						<li>Morphine has active metabolites (M3G and M6G) which may accumulate in renal impairment and contribute to toxic effects</li> 
						<li>Use extreme caution using Opioids in patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve </li>
						<li>Avinza: due to fumaric acid content, doses above 1600 mg may result in serious renal toxicity</li>
