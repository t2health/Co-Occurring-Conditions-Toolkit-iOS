					</ul> 
<hr>
					<h3>Disadvantages</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>Contraindications include hypersensitivity to morphine analogs such as codeine, respiratory depression (except in monitored settings and in the presence of resuscitative equipment), acute or severe bronchial asthma, hypercarbia, known or suspected paralytic ileus and patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment</li> 
					</ul>
<hr>
					<h3>Pregnancy Category</h3>

					<h3>Safety Margin</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>Oxymorphone is contraindicated with alcohol</li>
						<li>Do not administer Opioid agonist/ antagonist Analgesics (pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol) or partial agonists (buprenorphine) to a patient who is receiving a course of therapy with a pure agonist Opioid Analgesic since it may precipitate withdrawal symptoms</li> 
						<li>Avoid concomitant use with valerian, st. john's wort and kava kava</li>
						<li>Ultrarapid CYP2D6 metabolizers may convert codeine into morphine more rapidly and completely than others, resulting in higher than expected serum morphine levels and possible overdose symptoms</li> 
						<li>Use extreme caution and frequent monitoring in patients receiving transdermal fentanyl and any CYP3A4 inhibitor</li>
						<li>Serious potential for overdose in the Opioid novice, use with caution and with gradual dose increase. Start with the lowest dose possible </li>
						<li>All Opioids are contraindicated in patients who have received MAOIs within 14 days </li>
						<li>Morphine has active metabolites (M3G and M6G) which may accumulate in renal impairment and contribute to toxic effects</li> 
						<li>Use extreme caution using Opioids in patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve </li>
						<li>Avinza: due to fumaric acid content, doses above 1600 mg may result in serious renal toxicity</li> 					
					</ul>
<hr>
					<h3>Efficacy</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>Long acting Opioids are effective for continuous, chronic pain </li>
						<li>Opioids are highly effective in pain management </li>
