					</ul>

					<h3>Disadvantages</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>Contraindications include any situation where Opioids are contraindicated, such as patients with significant respiratory depression (in absence of resuscitative equipment or unmonitored situations), acute bronchial asthma, hypercarbia and known or suspected paralytic ileus</li> 
					</ul>
<hr>
					<h3>Pregnancy Category</h3>	
					<ul>
							<li>No evidence of risk in humans</li>

					<h3>Safety Margin</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>Do not administer Opioid agonist/ antagonist Analgesics (pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol) or partial agonists (buprenorphine) to a patient who is receiving a course of therapy with a pure agonist Opioid Analgesic since it may precipitate withdrawal symptoms</li> 
						<li>Avoid concomitant use with valerian, st. john's wort and kava kava</li>
						<li>Ultrarapid CYP2D6 metabolizers may convert codeine into morphine more rapidly and completely than others, resulting in higher than expected serum morphine levels and possible overdose symptoms</li> 
						<li>Use extreme caution and frequent monitoring in patients receiving transdermal fentanyl and any CYP3A4 inhibitor</li>
						<li>Serious potential for overdose in the Opioid novice, use with caution and with gradual dose increase. Start with the lowest dose possible </li>
						<li>All Opioids are contraindicated in patients who have received MAOIs within 14 days </li>
						<li>Morphine has active metabolites (M3G and M6G) which may accumulate in renal impairment and contribute to toxic effects</li> 
						<li>Use extreme caution using Opioids in patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve </li>
						<li>Avinza: due to fumaric acid content, doses above 1600 mg may result in serious renal toxicity</li> 					
					</ul>
