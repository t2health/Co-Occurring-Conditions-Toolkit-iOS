			<h3>Brand name: Duragesic</h3>
<hr>
					<h3>Adult Starting Dose (Max Per Day)</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>Initial dose = 25mcg/h transdermally q 72h </li>
						<li>Titration: Increments should be based on supplemental Opioid doses, using a ratio of 12mcg/h transdermal fentanyl for every 45mg/24 h of supplemental oral morphine equivalent</li> 
						<li>Make dose increases at least 3 days after initial dose then not more often than q 6 days thereafter as necessary</li>
					</ul>
<hr>
					<h3>Advantages</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>Treatment for chronic persistent pain. Do not use post-op or for acute pain </li> 
						<li>Consider in patients with persistent, moderate to severe pain who cannot take oral long acting morphine or methadone </li> 
						<li>The use entails special safety considerations. All prescribers should be thoroughly familiar with the product's prescribing information</li> 
						<li>Patients must receive a copy of the Medication Guide </li> 
						<li>In order to avoid any confusion, always write fentanyl in mcg/hr</li> 
					</ul> 
<hr>
					<h3>Disadvantages</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>Contraindications include patients who are not Opioid tolerant, management of acute pain or for shortterm treatment, management of post-op pain, mild pain, or intermittent pain, significant respiratory depression (especially in unmonitored settings), acute or severe bronchial asthma and known or suspected paralytic ileus</li> 
						<li>Should not be used in patients particularly susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention (increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, coma) </li>
						<li>Fentanyl patches should only be used in patients who are already receiving Opioid therapy, are Opioidtolerant, and require a daily dose at least equivalent to fentanyl 25mcg/ hour </li>
						<li>Avoid application of external heat sources (e.g., heating pads, electric blankets, heat lamps, saunas, hot tubs, hot baths, sunbathing, or heated water beds) to the application site while the patch is worn as heat may increase the release of fentanyl; Monitor for Opioid adverse effects and adjust dosage as necessary</li> 
						<li>Do not cut or alter the patch which could result in over dosage </li>
						<li>If leakage of the fentanyl gel occurs then wash any skin that has come in contact with the gel with copious amounts of water only. Do not use soap or alcohol</li>
				</ul>
<hr>
					<h3>Pregnancy Category</h3>	
					<ul>
							<li>Risk cannot be ruled out, but potential benefits may justify potential risk</li>	
					</ul>
<hr>
					<h3>Safety Margin</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>Do not administer Opioid agonist/ antagonist Analgesics (pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol) or partial agonists (buprenorphine) to a patient who is receiving a course of therapy with a pure agonist Opioid Analgesic since it may precipitate withdrawal symptoms</li> 
						<li>Avoid concomitant use with valerian, st. john's wort and kava kava</li>
						<li>Ultrarapid CYP2D6 metabolizers may convert codeine into morphine more rapidly and completely than others, resulting in higher than expected serum morphine levels and possible overdose symptoms</li> 
						<li>Use extreme caution and frequent monitoring in patients receiving transdermal fentanyl and any CYP3A4 inhibitor</li>
						<li>Serious potential for overdose in the Opioid novice, use with caution and with gradual dose increase. Start with the lowest dose possible </li>
						<li>All Opioids are contraindicated in patients who have received MAOIs within 14 days </li>
						<li>Morphine has active metabolites (M3G and M6G) which may accumulate in renal impairment and contribute to toxic effects</li> 
						<li>Use extreme caution using Opioids in patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve </li>
						<li>Avinza: due to fumaric acid content, doses above 1600 mg may result in serious renal toxicity</li> 					
					</ul>
<hr>
					<h3>Efficacy</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li>Long acting Opioids are effective for continuous, chronic pain </li>
						<li>Opioids are highly effective in pain management </li>
						<li>Methadone is FDA approved for the detoxification treatment of Opioid addiction; If used in detoxification, then it must be used as part of an FDA approved program</li>		
					</ul>
