  <p>NSAID and non-narcotic pain medications are recommended for use in the mTBI treatment of headaches. NSAID and acetaminophen are considered first-line treatment for treating tension headaches as an abortive agent. The choice of an NSAID or acetaminophen depends upon individual response and severity of side effects. Pain treatment is more likely to be successful if the medication is taken at the onset of a headache rather than waiting for the headache pain to escalate.</p> 
   		<p>Headaches associated with chronic NSAID/acetaminophen usage should be addressed to a headache specialist. Episodic tension-type headaches usually respond to NSAID that can be obtained over-the-counter</p>
   		<p><b>NSAIDs:</b> Use with caution and lower doses in hepatic impairment, renal impairment and in the elderly. May cause fluid retention and peripheral edema. Use caution in compromised cardiac function, hypertension or patients on chronic diuretic therapy. May inhibit platelet aggregation. Photosensitivity may occur. Advise patients to use caution and take protective measures. May cause drowsiness, dizziness, blurred vision. Advise patients to use caution when driving or operating machinery. Risk of GI irritation or GI bleed.</p> 
   		<p><b>Tramadol:</b> Use with caution in debilitated patients on tramadol IR. When using tramadol ER, use caution in the elderly &gt; 65 years, starting at low end of the dosing range; Use even greater caution in patients &gt; 75 years. Seizures reported within the recommended dosage range; Increased risk above recommended dosage range and in patient with seizure disorder, history of seizures, in conditions with increased risk of seizures, or with other drugs that increase seizure risk. Observe maximum dose limits. Use caution in patients with increased intracranial pressure or head injury.</p>
   		<p><b>Acetaminophen:</b> Use with caution in patients with alcoholic liver disease and in patients with G6PD deficiency. Patients who consume 3 or more alcohol containing drinks per day should ask their clinician whether to use acetaminophen or an alternative analgesic.</p>
