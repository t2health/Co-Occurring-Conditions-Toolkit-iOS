  <p><b>Monitoring, Referrals and Warnings:</b> In rare instances, varenicline has been associated with violent thoughts, intent or actions towards oneself or others. Patients with suicidal or assaultive thoughts, ideation, or behaviors within the past 12 months are not candidates for varenicline until judged to be stable by a mental health professional. Providers should strongly consider closer monitoring of mental health symptoms for patients with prior suicidality, if they ultimately utilize varenicline. </p>
