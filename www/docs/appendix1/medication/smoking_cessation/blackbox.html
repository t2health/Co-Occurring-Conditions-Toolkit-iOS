    <p><b>Black Box Warning:</b> Advise patients and caregivers that the patient should stop taking Chantix and contact a healthcare provider immediately if agitation, hostility, depressed mood, or changes in behavior or thinking that are not typical for the patient are observed, or if the patient develops suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior while taking Chantix or shortly after discontinuing Chantix. Weigh the risks of Chantix against benefits of its use since it has been demonstrated to increase the likelihood of abstinence from smoking for as long as one year compared to treatment with placebo.</p>
