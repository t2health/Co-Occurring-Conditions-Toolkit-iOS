  	<p><b>Black Box Warning:</b> Antidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in young adults (18-24) with MDD and other psychiatric disorders. Closely monitor for clinical worsening, suicidality or unusual changes in behavior particularly during the initial 1-2 months and during periods of dosage adjustments. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with Antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; There was a reduction in risk with Antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</p>
  	<p>Cases of life-threatening hepatic failure have been reported in patients treated with nefazodone. Treatment should not be started in individuals with active liver disease or with elevated baseline abnormalities. Advise patients to be alert for signs and symptoms of liver disease (jaundice, anorexia, GI complaints and malaise) and report these symptoms immediately if they occur.</p>
