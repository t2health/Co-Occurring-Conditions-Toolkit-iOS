			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>In June 2009, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) held a consensus conference on concussion, post-traumatic stress disorder and pain, with the goals of providing a consensus recommendation on the treatment of veterans with these comorbid conditions. Based on reviewed literature and consensus opinions of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) from the VA and Department of Defense (DoD), they determined that the treatments recommended in the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) are still recommended in the comorbid population. There was not evidence to suggest that the current CPGs were contraindicated. There are several excellent VA/DoD CPGs that address concussion, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, chronic opioid therapy (COT) and substance use disorder (SUD). These CPGs are not intended to address care in the deployed setting.  However, there are areas within these CPGs that may present challenges should a patient present with multiple conditions. This guide attempts to address these areas of conflict.</p>

			<p>This toolkit does not educate on how to make these diagnoses, but rather, on how to further evaluate what conditions may be resulting in the presenting symptoms. It was developed to give guidance to primary care providers on the assessment and management of these patients, synthesizing the information of the above CPGs. Evidenced-based approaches to the management of co-occurring disorders are emerging but have not reached fruition. To that end, SMEs from the Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury (DCoE), the Center for Deployment Psychology (CDP), the Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress (CSTS), the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center (DVBIC), the Deployment Health Clinical Center (DHCC), the National Center for Telehealth and Technology (T2) and the National Intrepid Center of Excellence (NICoE) gathered to provide expert opinion to address these gaps. As the science emerges, this toolkit will be revised to reflect the evidence.</p>
			
			<p>Given the occurrence of co-occurring conditions, a holistic approach that works to incorporate all spheres of the patient's life is essential to include family and spiritual aspects. While medications can be very effective, this patient population is at high risk for polypharmacy which may lead to significant drug-drug interactions. Utilizing non-pharmacological approaches where indicated and appropriate is critical. Emerging research in the area of complimentary treatments in this population may indicate therapeutic alternatives in the near future.</p>
			
			<p>Diagnostic criteria for the conditions are listed under the Provider Resources tab for reference. However, this guide is not intended to be used as a diagnostic tool. Rather, it is assumed that diagnoses have already been determined. Furthermore, this guide is designed to provide information and assist decision-making. It is not intended to define a standard of care and should not be construed as one. It should not be interpreted as prescribing an exclusive course of management and should not replace clinical judgment or consultation with a specialist when deemed appropriate. Every healthcare professional making use of this guide is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of applying the recommendations in the clinical setting.</p>
