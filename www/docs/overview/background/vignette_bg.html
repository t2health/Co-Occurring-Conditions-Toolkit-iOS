				<h2>Case Vignette: Background</h2>
				<p>SGT King, a 23 y/o male, active duty US Army service member, presents to PCM for continued sleep problems, headaches and irritability. Relevant history includes injuries sustained in OIF two months ago, when the HUMVEE he was driving was hit by an IED. He reports a brief period (seconds to minutes) of loss of consciousness (LOC) followed by some confusion. He recalls his buddy who was in the passenger seat shaking him awake. The vehicle took enemy fire following the explosion during which five other members of his platoon were killed in action (KIA), including the same battle buddy. The other two members in the vehicle were dazed but no LOC. He was subsequently seen and treated in theater. Since this explosion, he reports headaches and dizziness for several days which have only moderately improved in frequency.

He felt increased anxiety for several days following this incident. He also noted that he was increasingly forgetful on the medication. At this time, the PTSD Check List (PCL) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were administered. SGT King reported a high degree of symptoms consistent with PTSD (PCL total=67), and moderate levels of depression (PHQ-9 total=10). Notably, SGT King's pattern of symptom endorsement included that he was extremely bothered (rating of 5 on 1-5 scale) by disturbing dreams of a stressful experience (item #3).
