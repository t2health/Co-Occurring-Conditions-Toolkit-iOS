		<p>When seen initially in the primary care setting, the available appointment time is typically limited. Therefore, this section attempts to highlight areas that need to be addressed immediately. When seeing a post-deployment service member with a history of concussion and ongoing symptoms, a screening for potential co-occurring psychological health (PH) concerns should take place. In addition, several key areas of safety and symptoms should be addressed. General questions regarding the below topic areas should be followed up with specific questions to maximize clinical data.</p>		
			<ol>
				<li>Difficulty with sleep</li>
				<li>Nightmares</li>
				<li>Changes in mood (depression, anger, irritability)</li>
				<li>Suicidal or homicidal ideation</li>
				<li>Changes in cognitive function, attention</li>
				<li>Chronic pain</li>
				<li>New or worsening headaches</li>
				<li>Violence</li>
				<li>Substance use (alcohol, drugs, supplements)</li>
				<li>Difficulties with relationships</li>
				<li>Difficulties at work</li>
				<li>Medications used (includes over-the-counter)</li>
			</ol>
		<p>Suicidal and homicidal ideations are often associated with PTSD, SUD, and chronic pain and may certainly be seen at a higher prevalence in mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) when these disorders co-occur. Therefore, all patients where this guide would be used should routinely and carefully be evaluated for current suicidal and homicidal ideation, risk/protective factors, and past history of suicide attempts.</p>
		<p>Given the time constraints of the primary care appointments, there will likely not be the time to assess for the etiology of all symptoms. However, inquiring about the function of these key areas is important for guiding treatment. For example, a service member who sees shadows move when frightened may be having symptoms reflective of hyperarousal from PTSD or may be displaying signs of a psychotic disorder. The assessment of perceptual abnormalities can be difficult, however obtaining the initial information to assess for safety and the need for immediate referral is possible.</p>
		<p>There are no standard laboratory/neuroimaging studies or referrals that need to be ordered prior to the next visit unless clinically indicated (see table 1).</p>

		<h2>Tips for Structuring the Clinical Interaction</h2>
		<p>Below are some general tips for ways to most effectively structure appointments with service members with mild TBI and co-occurring PH problems. There is not a typical patient presentation as the pattern of symptoms vary widely depending on the conditions present. Some tailoring of the provider communication style will be important to maximize effective patient interaction. Common cognitive symptoms that may affect patient interactions include memory problems, slowed thought process, problems with organization, disinhibition and self-awareness.</p>
		<p>Thus, a longer appointment time is often required than most typical primary care appointments.</p>	
		<h3>Communication</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Use short, simple sentences</li>
			<li>Minimize the amount that is said at one time</li>
			<li>Speak slowly and clearly</li>
			<li>Use the same words when repeating information</li>
			<li>Summarize key points throughout appointment</li>
			<li>Allow the individual extra time to respond</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>External Aids</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Use written notes either by or for the individual</li>
			<li>Use diagrams, drawings, checklists</li>
			<li>Set session agendas</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Environment</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Meet with the individual more frequently, but for shorter therapy sessions</li>
			<li>Promote consistency by having a set meeting time and structure of the therapy activity</li>
			<li>Hold sessions at the individual's best time of day</li>
			<li>Be open to between session contact to assist individual in carrying-over information</li>
			<li>Plan for longer duration of treatment</li>
			<li>Minimize distractions in therapy and appointment environments</li>
		</ul>
