    		<h4>Overview</h4>
    		<p>The AUDIT-C is a 3-item alcohol screen that can help identify persons who are hazardous drinkers or have active alcohol use disorders (including alcohol abuse or dependence). The AUDIT-C is a modified version of the 10 question AUDIT instrument.</p>
    	</div>
    	<div>
    		<h4>Clinical Utility</h4>
    		<p>The AUDIT-C is a brief alcohol screen that reliably identifies patients who are hazardous drinkers or have active alcohol use disorders.</p>
    	</div>
    	<div>
    		<h4>Scoring</h4>
    		<p>The AUDIT-C is scored on a scale of 0-12. Each AUDIT-C question has 5 answer choices. Points allotted are: a = 0 points, b = 1 point, c = 2 points, d = 3 points, e = 4 points</p>
    		<ul>
    			<li><b>In men,</b> a score of 4 or more is considered positive, optimal for identifying hazardous drinking or active alcohol use disorders.</li>
    			<li><b>In women,</b> a score of 3 or more is considered positive (same as above).</li>
    			<li>However, when the points are all from Question #1 alone (#2 and #3 are zero), it can be assumed that the patient is drinking below recommended limits and it is suggested that the provider review the patient’s alcohol intake over the past few months to confirm accuracy.3</li>
    			<li>Generally, the higher the score, the more likely it is that the patient’s drinking is affecting his or her safety.</li>
    		</ul>
