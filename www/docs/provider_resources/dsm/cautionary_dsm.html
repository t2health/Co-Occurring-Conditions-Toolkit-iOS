    		<li>The specified diagnostic criteria for each psychological disorder are offered as guidelines for making diagnoses, because it has been demonstrated that the use of such criteria enhances agreement among clinicians and investigators; The proper use of these criteria requires specialized clinical training that provides both a body of knowledge and clinical skills</li> 
    		<li>These diagnostic criteria and the DSM-IV Classification of psychological disorders reflect a consensus of current formulations of evolving knowledge in our field; They do not encompass, however, all the conditions for which people may be treated or that may be appropriate topics for research efforts </li>
    		<li>The purpose of DSM-IV is to provide clear descriptions of diagnostic categories in order to enable clinicians and investigators to diagnose, communicate about, study, and treat people with various psychological disorders; It is to be understood that inclusion here, for clinical and research purposes, of a diagnostic category such as Pathological Gambling or Pedophilia does not imply that the condition meets legal or other nonmedical criteria for what constitutes psychological disease, psychological disorder, or psychological disability The clinical and scientific considerations involved in categorization of these conditions as psychological disorders may not be wholly relevant to legal judgments, for example, that take into account such issues as individual responsibility, disability determination and competency</li>
