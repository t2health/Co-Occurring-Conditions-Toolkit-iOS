    	<p>Refer to the DSM-IV TR for full diagnostic criteria</p>
    	<p><b>A maladaptive pattern of substance use, leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by
three (or more) of the following seven criteria, occurring at any time in the same 12-month period:</b></p>
    	
    	<p><b><font color="red">A.</font> Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:</b></p>
			<ol>
				<li>A need for markedly increased amounts of the substance to achieve intoxication or desired effect</li>
				<li>Markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the substance</li>
			</ol>
			
		
		    	<p><b><font color="red">B.</font> Withdrawal, as defined by either of the following:</b></p>
			<ol>
				<li>The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the substance (refer to DSM-IV-TR for further details)</li>
				<li>The same (or a closely related) substance is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms</li> 
			</ol>
		
		    	<p><b><font color="red">C.</font> The substance is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended</b></p>
			
		    	<p><b><font color="red">D.</font> There is a persistent desire or there are unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control substance use</b></p>

			<p><b><font color="red">E.</font> A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the substance (e.g., visiting multiple doctors or driving long distances to see one), use the substance (e.g., chain smoking), or recover from its effects</b></p>
			<p><b><font color="red">F.</font> Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of substance use</b></p>
			<p><b><font color="red">G.</font> The substance use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the substance (e.g.,current cocaine use despite recognition of cocaine-induced depression or continued drinking despite recognition that an ulcer was made worse by alcohol consumption); Dependence exists on a continuum of severity: remission requires a period of at least 30 days without meeting full diagnostic criteria and is specified as Early (first 12 months) or Sustained (beyond 12 months) and Partial (some continued criteria met) versus Full (no criteria met)</b></p>
