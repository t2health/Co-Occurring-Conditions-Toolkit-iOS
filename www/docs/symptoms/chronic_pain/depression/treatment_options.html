                    <h3>First Steps</h3>
                    <p>Evaluate for existing or emerging medical conditions that may be causing pain and could exacerbate conditions. Initial treatment approach for all conditions includes evaluating for self-treatment of pain to include over-the-counter medications, alcohol, illicit substances and self-dosing of prescription drugs. Utilization of assessment tools may assist with identifying higher risk co-occurring conditions. Tailor pain treatment to the characteristics of pain (i.e., type, frequency, duration, etc.).</p> 
						<ul>
							<li>Educate patient and family about relationship between depression and pain; Depression lowers pain threshold and increases subjective 'suffering' induced by a given amount of pain</li>
							<li>Consider non-pharmacological treatments (e.g., PT/OT, biofeedback, acupuncture, etc.) vs. a short course of medications for pain treatment if required, utilizing non-narcotics as possible</li>
							<li>Consider course of medications (e.g., <a href="../../../../docs/appendix1/medication/snri/index.html">SNRIs</a>) that may help both depression and neuropathic pain</li>
							<li>Consider initiation of treatment for depression by medications vs referral to Behavioral Health</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Second Steps</h3>
						<p>Reassess for efficacy of initial intervention utilizing the same tools from First Steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Consider follow up in 3-4 weeks, sooner if clinically indicated</li>
							<li>Adjust medications, if started</li>
							<li>If chronic narcotics are required, recommend utilization of a pain contract to ensure a single prescribing provider with specialty involvement, both Pain Clinic and Behavioral Health</li>
							<li>Re-examine for possible co-occurring psychological health diagnosis</li>
							<li>As depression treatment improves there is usually a decrease in associated pain symptoms unless there are underlying comorbidities; Thus, both conditions should be aggressively treated</li>
