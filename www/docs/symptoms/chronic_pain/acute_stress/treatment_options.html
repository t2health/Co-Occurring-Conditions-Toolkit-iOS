                   <h3>First Steps</h3>
                   <p>Evaluate for existing or emerging medical conditions that may be causing pain and could exacerbate conditions. Initial treatment approach for all conditions includes evaluating for self-treatment of pain to include over-the-counter medications, alcohol, illicit substances and self-dosing of prescription drugs. Utilization of assessment tools may assist with identifying higher risk co-occurring conditions. Tailor pain treatment to the characteristics of pain (i.e., type, frequency, duration, etc.).</p> 
                   		<ul>
							<li>Assess for connection between ASD and pain symptoms (pain triggering memories of trauma); Educate patient and family regarding the relationship between disorders</li>
							<li>Consider non-pharmacological treatments (e.g., PT/OT, biofeedback, acupuncture, etc.) vs. a short course of medications for pain treatment if required, utilizing non-narcotics as possible</li>
							<li>Consider referral to Behavioral Health early</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Second Steps</h3>
						<p>Reassess for efficacy of initial intervention utilizing the same tools from First Steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Consider follow up in 1-2 weeks minimum, sooner if clinically indicated; Patient needs to be seen 30 days post-event for assessment of progression to PTSD</li>
							<li>If chronic narcotics are required, recommend utilization of a pain contract to ensure a single prescribing provider with consideration of concurrent referral to Pain Specialist</li> 
							<li>Consider referral to Behavioral Health if not completed</li> 
							<li>Re-examine for possible co-occurring psychological health diagnosis</li>
