                    <h3>First Steps</h3>
                    <p>Evaluate for existing or emerging medical conditions that may be causing pain and could exacerbate conditions. Initial treatment approach for all conditions includes evaluating for self-treatment of pain to include over-the-counter medications, alcohol, illicit substances and self-dosing of prescription drugs. Utilization of assessment tools may assist with identifying higher risk co-occurring conditions. Tailor pain treatment to the characteristics of pain (i.e., type, frequency, duration, etc.).</p> 
						<ul>
							<li>Assess for red flags that may indicate need for immediate neuroimaging and/or specialty referral</li>
							<li>Educate patient and family regarding diagnosis and management expectations</li>
							<li>Treatment approaches should include consideration of:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Abortive medications: (e.g., <a href="../../../../docs/appendix1/medication/nsaid/index.html">NSAIDs</a>, Triptans, antiemetics)</li>
								<li>Prophylactic medications: consideration of medication to use should be based on potential side effects and potential for concurrent treatment of another condition</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Prophylactic medications may not begin to take effect for 4-6 weeks</li>
							<li>Recommend use of headache diary and a close assessment of potential triggers that may be addressed by other means (e.g., sleep disturbance, stress management, etc.)</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
						<h3>Second Steps</h3>
						<p>Reassess for efficacy of initial intervention utilizing the same tools from First Steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Follow up in 2-3 weeks, sooner if clinically indicated</li>
							<li>Assess medication effects and consider dosage adjustments</li>
							<li>Consider alternative therapies if indicated (e.g., biofeedback, acupuncture, etc.)</li>
							<li>Consider Neurology referral if headaches are unresponsive to treatments or pain is resulting in significant functional deficits</li>
							<li>Re-examine for possible co-occurring psychological health diagnosis</li>
						</ul>
