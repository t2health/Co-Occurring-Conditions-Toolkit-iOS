                    <h3>First Steps</h3>
                    <p>Evaluate for existing or emerging medical conditions that may be causing pain and could exacerbate conditions. Initial treatment approach for all conditions includes evaluating for self-treatment of pain to include over-the-counter medications, alcohol, illicit substances and self-dosing of prescription drugs. Utilization of assessment tools may assist with identifying higher risk co-occurring conditions. Tailor pain treatment to the characteristics of pain (i.e., type, frequency, duration, etc.).</p> 
						<ul>
							<li>Educate patient and family regarding etiology of pain as well as increased risk for occurrence of co-occurring conditions, especially depression</li>
							<li>Consider early involvement of Behavioral Health in those patients with chronic refractory pain</li>
							<li>If chronic narcotics are required, recommend utilization of a pain contract to ensure a single prescribing provider with consideration of concurrent referral to Pain Specialist</li>
							<li>Tailor treatment plan to patient's circumstances and pain characteristics</li>
							<li>Consider use of non-pharmacological therapies when able (e.g., biofeedback, therapeutic exercise, acupuncture, etc.)</li>
							<li>Refer to COT CPG for treatment of short, intermittent and continuous pain</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Second Steps</h3>
						<p>Reassess for efficacy of initial intervention utilizing the same tools from First Steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Consider follow up in 1-2 weeks initially, sooner if clinically indicated</li>
							<li>Consider interdisciplinary approach</li>                         
						</ul>
