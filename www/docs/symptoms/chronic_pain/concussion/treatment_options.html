						<h3>First Steps</h3>
						<p>Evaluate for existing or emerging medical conditions that may be causing pain and could exacerbate conditions. Initial treatment approach for all conditions includes evaluating for self-treatment of pain to include over-the-counter medications, alcohol, illicit substances and self-dosing of prescription drugs. Utilization of assessment tools may assist with identifying higher risk co-occurring conditions. Tailor pain treatment to the characteristics of pain (i.e., type, frequency, duration, etc.).</p> 
						<ul>
							<li>Assess for red flags that may indicate need for immediate neuroimaging and/or specialty referral; Evaluate for potential co-occurring bodily injury</li>
							<li>Educate patient and family about symptoms and recovery patterns of concussion</li>
							<li>Treatment for physical complaints should be based upon a thorough evaluation, individual factors and symptom presentation</li>
							<li>Treatment should include:</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Non-pharmacological interventions (e.g., relaxation, PT/OT, acupuncture and modification of the environment)</li>
									<li>Use of medications to relieve pain (e.g., non-narcotic pain meds, <a href="../../../../docs/appendix1/medication/nsaid/index.html">NSAIDs</a>, Triptans for migrainous headaches)</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Consultation or referral to specialist if there are atypical or other neurologic conditions</li>
							<li>Be aware that pain interferes with sleep and cognition and treat aggressively prior to deciding the patient has an attention or other cognitive deficit secondary to a concussion</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Second Steps</h3>
						<p>Reassess for efficacy of initial intervention utilizing the same tools from First Steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Follow up in 2-3 weeks, sooner if clinically indicated</li>
							<li>Re-examine for possible co-occurring psychological health diagnosis</li>
							<li>Consider referral to specialty clinic if pain is resulting in significant functional deficits or requiring high dose narcotics</li>
						</ul>
