         	<h3>First Steps</h3>
         	<p>Evaluate for existing or emerging medical conditions that may be causing pain and could exacerbate conditions. Initial treatment approach for all conditions includes evaluating for self-treatment of pain to include over-the-counter medications, alcohol, illicit substances and self-dosing of prescription drugs. Utilization of assessment tools may assist with identifying higher risk co-occurring conditions. Tailor pain treatment to the characteristics of pain (i.e., type, frequency, duration, etc.).</p> 
						<ul>
							<li>Consider and assess whether substance use is a form of self-medication, or developed secondary to polypharmacy; In these cases, coordinate and refer for the treatment of chronic pain and for the treatment of substance use disorder</li>
							<li>Educate patient and family on adverse effects of substance use</li>
							<li>Consider baseline labs</li>
							<li>Address co-occurring medical and psychological conditions</li>
							<li>Refer for substance abuse therapy (and detoxification if needed)</li>
							<li>Refer to community and peer support</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Second Steps</h3>
						<p>Reassess for efficacy of initial intervention utilizing the same tools from First Steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Follow up interval and frequency dependent on other treatments initiated during First Steps</li>
							<li>Coordinate care with specialty clinics to include Pain Specialist</li>
