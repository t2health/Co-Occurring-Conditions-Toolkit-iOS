                   <h3>First Steps</h3>
                   <p>Initial treatment approach for all conditions includes evaluating for medications that may impair cognition (e.g., narcotics, sleeping aids, etc.) as well as other diagnoses (e.g., sleep disturbance). Substance misuse should also be ruled out. Utilization of assessment tools may assist with this.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Educate patient and family about depression symptoms to include poor concentration, attention and a motivation</li>
							<li>Consider initiation of medications for depression vs referral for Behavioral Health care</li>
							<li>As depression improves with treatment, there is a corresponding increase in cognitive/attention functioning</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Second Steps</h3>
						<p>Reassess for efficacy of initial intervention utilizing the same tools from First Steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Consider follow up in 3-4 weeks, sooner if clinically indicated</li>
							<li>Adjust medications, if started</li>
							<li>Consider referral to Behavioral Health for treatment of depression</li>
							<li>Re-examine for possible co-occurring psychological health diagnosis</li>
