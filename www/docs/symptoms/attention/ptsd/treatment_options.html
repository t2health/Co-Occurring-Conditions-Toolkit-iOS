                    <h3>First Steps</h3>
                    <p>Initial treatment approach for all conditions includes evaluating for medications that may impair cognition (e.g., narcotics, sleeping aids, etc.) as well as other diagnoses (e.g., sleep disturbance). Substance misuse should also be ruled out. Utilization of assessment tools may assist with this.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Educate patient and family about PTSD symptoms such as poor attention and other memory/cognitive problems</li>
							<li>Memory, concentration and attention difficulties may be due to anxiety or preoccupation with thoughts related to PTSD</li>
							<li>Consider initiation of medications for PTSD vs referral for specialized Behavioral Health care; Treatment of this underlying disorder should improve attention/concentration</li>
                          </ul>
						<h3>Second Steps</h3>
						<p>Reassess for efficacy of initial intervention utilizing the same tools from First Steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Follow up in 3-4 weeks, sooner if clinically indicated</li>
							<li>Consider referral to Behavioral Health for treatment of PTSD</li>
							<li>Re-examine for possible co-occurring psychological health diagnosis</li>
						</ul>
