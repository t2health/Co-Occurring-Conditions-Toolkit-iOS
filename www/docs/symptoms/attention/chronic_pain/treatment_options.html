                    <h3>First Steps</h3>
                    <p>Initial treatment approach for all conditions includes evaluating for medications that may impair cognition (e.g., narcotics, sleeping aids, etc.) as well as other diagnoses (e.g., sleep disturbance). Substance misuse should also be ruled out. Utilization of assessment tools may assist with this.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Carefully examine relationship between symptoms and timing of medication doses</li>
							<li>Consider medications for breakthrough pain with non-narcotics if possible</li>
							<li>Consider referral to PT/OT and non-pharmacological treatments (e.g., biofeedback, acupuncture, etc.)</li>
							<li>If narcotics are necessary, 1) recommend initiation of written contract for treatment with opioids to help ensure single prescribing provider; 2) addition of short-acting narcotics to titrate to optimal dose with precise documentation required by provider and patient (timing, dosage, pain relief, and adverse effects)</li>
							<li>Once the pain is managed appropriately, cognitive functioning, including attention will improve. No additional treatment is recommended</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Second Steps</h3>
						<p>Reassess for efficacy of initial intervention utilizing the same tools from First Steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Follow up in 1-3 weeks, sooner if clinically indicated</li>
							<li>Close follow up is required</li>
							<li>Referral to Pain Specialist as needed</li>
							<li>Re-examine for possible co-occurring psychological health diagnosis</li>                         
						</ul>
