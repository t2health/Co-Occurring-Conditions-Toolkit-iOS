                    <h3>First Steps</h3>
                    <p>Initial treatment approach for all conditions includes evaluating for medications that may impair cognition (e.g., narcotics, sleeping aids, etc.) as well as other diagnoses (e.g., sleep disturbance). Substance misuse should also be ruled out. Utilization of assessment tools may assist with this.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Educate patient and family about the frequently existing relationship between chronic headaches and mood disorders that can impact attention</li>
							<li>Have patient utilize headache diary in attempt to identify and adjust aggravating triggers to headaches</li>
							<li>Carefully review medications as many prophylactic medications may affect attention/concentration (e.g., <li><a href="../../../../docs/appendix1/medication/beta-ad/index.html">beta-blockers</a>, <a href="../../../../docs/appendix1/medication/anticonvul/index.html">antiepileptics</a>, <a href="../../../../docs/appendix1/medication/tca/index.html">TCAs</a>, etc.)</li>
							<li>Treatment of headaches and any co-occurring mood disorder should improve attention/concentration</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Second Steps</h3>
						<p>Reassess for efficacy of initial intervention utilizing the same tools from First Steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Follow up in 2-3 weeks, sooner if clinically indicated</li>
							<li>Re-examine for possible co-occurring psychological health diagnosis</li>
							<li>Consider Neurology referral</li>
						</ul>
