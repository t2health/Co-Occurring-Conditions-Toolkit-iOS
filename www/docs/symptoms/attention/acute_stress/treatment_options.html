                    <h3>First Steps</h3>
                    <p>Initial treatment approach for all conditions includes evaluating for medications that may impair cognition (e.g., narcotics, sleeping aids, etc.) as well as other diagnoses (e.g., sleep disturbance). Substance misuse should also be ruled out. Utilization of assessment tools may assist with this.</p> 
                    	<ul>
							<li>Educate patient and family about ASD symptoms such as dissociation; Create an expectation of recovery</li>
							<li>Psychological Debriefing is not recommended for the reduction of ASD or for prevention of progression to PTSD</li>
							<li>There is insufficient evidence to recommend use of a pharmacological agent to prevent PTSD</li>
							<li>Consider initiation of medications for ASD vs referral for Behavioral Health care; Treatment of the underlying disorder (ASD) should improve attention/concentration</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Second Steps</h3>
						<p>Reassess for efficacy of initial intervention utilizing the same tools from First Steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Consider follow up in 1-2 weeks minimum, sooner if clinically indicated; Patient needs to be seen 30 days post-event for assessment of progression to PTSD</li>
							<li>Consider referral to Behavioral Health for treatment of ASD</li>
							<li>Re-examine for possible co-occurring psychological health diagnosis</li>
