						<h3>First Steps</h3>
						<p>Initial treatment approach for all conditions includes evaluating for medications that may impair cognition (e.g., narcotics, sleeping aids, etc.) as well as other diagnoses (e.g., sleep disturbance). Substance misuse should also be ruled out. Utilization of assessment tools may assist with this.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Educate patient and family about symptoms and recovery patterns</li>
							<li>Treatment for psychiatric/behavioral symptoms should be based upon individual factors and nature of severity of symptoms presentation</li>
							<li>Patients should be encouraged to implement life-style changes including exercise, nutritious diet, relaxation training, scheduling leisure activities and pacing to improve treatment outcome</li>
							<li>Use caution with medications that may cause sedation or confusion (e.g., hyponotics and anxiolytics)</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Second Steps</h3>
						<p>Reassess for efficacy of initial intervention utilizing the same tools from First Steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Follow up in 2-3 weeks, sooner if clinically indicated</li>
							<li>Consider referral for cognitive rehabilitation</li>
							<li>Re-examine for possible co-occurring psychological health diagnosis</li>
							<li>Consider medications to treat fatigue which may affect attention (in specialty care after ruling out sleep disturbance):</li>
