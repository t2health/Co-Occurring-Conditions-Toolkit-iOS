						<h3>First Steps</h3>
						<p>Initial treatment approach for all conditions includes ruling out medication side effects as well as other diagnoses such as sleep apnea. Utilization of assessment tools may assist with this. Education of diagnosis as well as an emphasis on sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques and correction of circadian rhythm disruptions from travel are important initial steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>If pain is present in disrupting sleep, medication and/or physical therapy to relieve pain.</li>
							<li>Assess for sleep disorders as these may occur secondary to TBI; Refer for sleep evaluation as needed.</li>
                       	 <li>May consider non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (limit dose/duration to 7-10 days).</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Second Steps</h3>
						<p>Reassess for efficacy of initial intervention utilizing the same tools from First Steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Follow up in 7-10 days, sooner if clinically indicated</li>
							<li>Specialty care may prescribe modafinil or other stimulants if fatigue present despite resolution of sleep issues</li>
						</ul>
