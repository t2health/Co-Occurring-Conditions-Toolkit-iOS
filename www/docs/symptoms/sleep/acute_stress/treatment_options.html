                    <h3>First Steps</h3>
                    <p>Initial treatment approach for all conditions includes ruling out medication side effects as well as other diagnoses such as sleep apnea. Utilization of assessment tools may assist with this. Education of diagnosis as well as an emphasis on sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques and correction of circadian rhythm disruptions from travel are important initial steps.</p>
						<p><b>Strongly recommend against the use of benzodiazepines for prevention of ASD. </b></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Consider watchful waiting vs. initiation of medications for sleep disturbance vs. referral for psychotherapy for ASD</li>
                            <li>Medications for sleep disturbance/insomnia:</li>
                            	<ul>
                                    <li>Chloral hydrate (limit to 5-7 days)</li>
                                    <li>Non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (limit to 5-7 days)</li>
                            	</ul>
						</ul>
						<h3>Second Steps</h3>
						<p>Reassess for efficacy of initial intervention utilizing the same tools from First Steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Consider follow up in 7-14 days depending on symptom severity and functional impairment; At minimum, patient should be seen at 30 days post-event for assessment of progression to PTSD</li>
							<li>For watchful waiting, monitor ASD symptoms for the development of PTSD using a validated measure of PTSD (e.g., PCL)</li>
                            <li>For individuals with significant symptoms or full diagnosis of ASD, consider referral to Behavioral Health for treatment of sleep disturbance or ASD:</li>
                            <ul>
                            	<li>CBT regarding fear of going to sleep</li>
								<li>Brief course of Exposure Therapy</li>
								<li>Brief course of CPT</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Psychological Debriefing is not recommended for the reduction of ASD or for prevention of progression to PTSD</li>
