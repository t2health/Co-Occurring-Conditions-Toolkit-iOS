                   <h3>First Steps</h3>
                   <p>Initial treatment approach for all conditions includes ruling out medication side effects as well as other diagnoses such as sleep apnea. Utilization of assessment tools may assist with this. Education of diagnosis as well as an emphasis on sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques and correction of circadian rhythm disruptions from travel are important initial steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Consider baseline labs</li>
							<li>Refer for substance abuse therapy (and detoxification if needed)</li>
							<li>Refer to community and peer support</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Second Steps</h3>
						<p>Reassess for efficacy of initial intervention utilizing the same tools from First Steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Follow up interval and frequency dependent on other treatments initiated during First Steps</li>
							<li>Discuss treatment options and arrive at shared decision regarding the treatment plan</li>
							<li>Interdisciplinary approach is strongly recommended</li>
							<li>Coordinate care with specialty clinics</li>
							<li>Monitor and discuss problems/emerging needs through ongoing treatment plan updates</li>
							<li>Recommend and offer nicotine cessation treatments to patients with nicotine dependence, monitoring for potential drug-drug interactions</li>
