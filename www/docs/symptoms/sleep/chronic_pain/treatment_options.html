                    <h3>First Steps</h3>
                    <p>Initial treatment approach for all conditions includes ruling out medication side effects as well as other diagnoses such as sleep apnea. Utilization of assessment tools may assist with this. Education of diagnosis as well as an emphasis on sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques and correction of circadian rhythm disruptions from travel are important initial steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>If sleep apnea is present, use caution with medications; Refer to a sleep specialist for appropriate apnea treatment</li>
							<li>Consider medications for breakthrough pain with non-narcotics if possible</li>
							<li>Consider referral to PT/OT, and non-pharmacological treatments (biofeedback, acupuncture, etc.)</li>
							<li>If narcotics are necessary: 1) recommend initiation of written contract for treatment with opioids to help ensure single prescribing provider; 2) addition of short-acting narcotics to titrate to optimal dose with precise documentation required by provider and patient (timing, dosage, pain relief and adverse effects)</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Second Steps</h3>
						<p>Reassess for efficacy of initial intervention utilizing the same tools from First Steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Follow up in 1-2 weeks to evaluate pain relief, sooner if clinically indicated</li>
							<li>Close follow up is required</li>
							<li>Refer to Pain Specialist as needed</li>                          
						</ul>
