                   <h3>First Steps</h3>
                   <p>Evaluate for existing or emerging medical conditions (e.g., hypo/hyperthyroidism, sleep disorder, etc.) that may cause mood symptoms and could exacerbate the below conditions. Evaluate for medication side effects that may cause mood disturbance (e.g., beta-blockers, etc.). Substance misuse should also be ruled out. Utilization of assessment tools may assist with identifying higher risk co-occurring conditions. Evaluate for safety and suicide/homicide-risk.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Educate patient and family about PTSD mood symptoms; Common mood symptoms in PTSD include trauma-related fear with anxious arousal, numbing of emotional response, and irritability/anger</li>
							<li>Consider initiation of medication for PTSD</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Initiate monotherapy with <a href="../../../../docs/appendix1/medication/ssri/index.html">SSRIs</a> or <a href="../../../../docs/appendix1/medication/snri/index.html">SNRIs</a> (preferred)</li>
							</ul>
								<li>Consider a referral to Behavioral Health in patients with PTSD; If PTSD is comorbid with depression, psychotherapeutic treatment of primary PTSD may result in improvement in depression; Consider referral to Behavioral Health early in course of treatment among individuals where PTSD is comorbid with other psychiatric conditions</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Referral to Behavioral Health for psychotherapy for PTSD (e.g., Prolonged Exposure Therapy) or to address specific mood symptoms (e.g., anger management for irritability)</li>
                            </ul>
                          </ul>
					
						<h3>Second Steps</h3>
						<p>Reassess for efficacy of initial intervention utilizing the same tools from First Steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Follow up in 3-4 weeks, sooner if clinically indicated</li>
							<li>Consider adjunctive medications when treatment response is suboptimal after 8 weeks of monotherapy</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Consider prazosin as adjunctive therapy for nightmares</li>
								</ul>
							<li>The VA/ DoD  PTSD CPG recommends against the use of risperidone as an adjunctive medication for PTSD; there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against other atypical antipsychotics as an adjunctive treatment for PTSD</li>
							<li>The evidence does NOT support the use of anticonvulsants or atypical antipsychotics as a monotherapy for PTSD</li>
							<li>There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of typical antipsychotics as monotherapy or adjunct for PTSD</li>
							<li>Consider referral to Behavioral Health, if this was not previously done</li>
							<li>A thorough assessment of mood symptoms and comorbid diagnoses is essential to effective treatment</li>
