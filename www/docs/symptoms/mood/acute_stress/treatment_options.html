                   <h3>First Steps</h3>
                   <p>Evaluate for existing or emerging medical conditions (e.g., hypo/hyperthyroidism, sleep disorder, etc.) that may cause mood symptoms and could exacerbate the below conditions. Evaluate for medication side effects that may cause mood disturbance (e.g., beta-blockers, etc.). Substance misuse should also be ruled out. Utilization of assessment tools may assist with identifying higher risk co-occurring conditions. Evaluate for safety and suicide/homicide-risk.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Educate patient and family about ASD mood symptoms; Common mood symptoms in ASD include numbing of emotional response, and associated features such as irritability/anger</li>
							<li>Consider watchful waiting (with appropriate patient education) vs. initiation of medications for ASD vs. referral to Behavioral Health for treatment</li>
								<ul>
									<li>For watchful waiting, monitor ASD symptoms with a validated measure of PTSD (e.g., PCL)</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Psychological Debriefing is not recommended for reduction of ASD or for prevention of progression to PTSD</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Second Steps</h3>
						<p>Reassess for efficacy of initial intervention utilizing the same tools from First Steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Follow up in 1-2 weeks depending on symptom severity and functional impairment; At minimum, patient should be seen at 30 days post-event for assessment of progression to PTSD</li>
							<li>Consider referral to Behavioral Health for treatment</li>
