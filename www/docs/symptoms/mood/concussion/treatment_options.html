						<h3>First Steps</h3>
						<p>Evaluate for existing or emerging medical conditions (e.g., hypo/hyperthyroidism, sleep disorder, etc.) that may cause mood symptoms and could exacerbate the below conditions. Evaluate for medication side effects that may cause mood disturbance (e.g., beta-blockers, etc.). Substance misuse should also be ruled out. Utilization of assessment tools may assist with identifying higher risk co-occurring conditions. Evaluate for safety and suicide/homicide-risk.</p> 
						<ul>
							<li>Educate patient and family about symptoms and recovery patterns</li>
							<li>Treatment for psychiatric/behavioral symptoms should be based upon individual factors and nature of severity of symptoms presentation; Assess for mood disorder vs. post-concussive fatigue</li>
							<li>Mood changes in concussion often are exacerbated by over stimulation or even strong stimulation (e.g., bright lights, loud noises, other forms of stimulus overload), and may be treated by placing patient in quiet and non-demanding environment</li>
							<li>Consider watchful waiting vs. referral to Behavioral Health treatment of mood disorder vs. initiation of medications for mood (e.g.,<a href="../../../../docs/appendix1/medication/ssri/index.html">SSRIs</a>, <a href="../../../../docs/appendix1/medication/snri/index.html">SNRIs</a>, etc.)</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Second Steps</h3>
						<p>Reassess for efficacy of initial intervention utilizing the same tools from First Steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Follow up in 2-3 weeks, sooner if clinically indicated</li>
							<li>Consider specialty referral to:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Cognitive rehabilitation</li>
								<li>Behavioral Health</li>
								<li>TBI specialist</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Assess for co-occurring conditions</li>
						</ul>
