                    <h3>First Steps</h3>
                    <p>Evaluate for existing or emerging medical conditions (e.g., hypo/hyperthyroidism, sleep disorder, etc.) that may cause mood symptoms and could exacerbate the below conditions. Evaluate for medication side effects that may cause mood disturbance (e.g., beta-blockers, etc.). Substance misuse should also be ruled out. Utilization of assessment tools may assist with identifying higher risk co-occurring conditions. Evaluate for safety and suicide/homicide-risk.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Educate patient and family about symptoms of mood disorder and recovery patterns</li>
							<li>Consider watchful waiting (with appropriate patient education) vs. initiation of treatment with either medications or with psychotherapy vs. referral to Behavioral Health for treatment</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Second Steps</h3>
						<p>Reassess for efficacy of initial intervention utilizing the same tools from First Steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Consider follow up in 3-4 weeks, sooner if clinically indicated</li>
							<li>Adjust medications, if started</li>
							<li>Consider referral to Behavioral Health if:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Failure to respond to treatment (e.g., 2 or more courses antidepressants)</li>
								<li>Three months of treatment without improvement</li>
								<li>Need for psychotherapy or combination psychotherapy and medication</li>
								<li>Urgent or unstable psychiatric condition</li>
								<li>Co-existing psychological or medical health condition that complicates treatment</li>
								<li>History of suicide attempts or suicidal ideation</li>
								<li>Concerns about adherence to treatment</li>
							</ul>
