                   <h3>First Steps</h3>
                   <p>Evaluate for existing or emerging medical conditions (e.g., hypo/hyperthyroidism, sleep disorder, etc.) that may cause mood symptoms and could exacerbate the below conditions. Evaluate for medication side effects that may cause mood disturbance (e.g., beta-blockers, etc.). Substance misuse should also be ruled out. Utilization of assessment tools may assist with identifying higher risk co-occurring conditions. Evaluate for safety and suicide/homicide-risk.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Educate patient and family on adverse effects of substance use</li>
							<li>Consider referral to Substance Specialty Clinic, vs. coordinating care with specialty clinics</li>
							<li>Refer to community and peer support (e.g., AA/NA)</li>
							<li>Monitor and discuss problems/emerging needs through ongoing treatment plan updates</li>
							<li>Prioritize and address co-occurring medical and psychiatric conditions</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Second Steps</h3>
						<p>Reassess for efficacy of initial intervention utilizing the same tools from First Steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Follow up interval and frequency dependent on other treatments initiated during First Steps</li>
							<li>Coordinate care with specialty clinics to include Pain Specialist</li>
							<li>Interdisciplinary approach is strongly recommended</li>
							<li>Recommend and offer nicotine cessation treatments to patients with nicotine dependence, monitoring for potential drug-drug interactions</li>
