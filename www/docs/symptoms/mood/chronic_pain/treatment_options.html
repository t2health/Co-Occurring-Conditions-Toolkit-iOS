                    <h3>First Steps</h3>
                    <p>Evaluate for existing or emerging medical conditions (e.g., hypo/hyperthyroidism, sleep disorder, etc.) that may cause mood symptoms and could exacerbate the below conditions. Evaluate for medication side effects that may cause mood disturbance (e.g., beta-blockers, etc.). Substance misuse should also be ruled out. Utilization of assessment tools may assist with identifying higher risk co-occurring conditions. Evaluate for safety and suicide/homicide-risk.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Education regarding relationship between chronic pain and mood disturbance; Depression lowers pain threshold and increases subjective 'suffering' induced by a given amount of pain</li>
							<li>Consider watchful waiting (with appropriate patient education) vs. initiation of treatment with either medications or with psychotherapy vs. referral to Behavioral Health for treatment</li>
							<li>Consider non-pharmacological treatments (e.g., PT/OT, biofeedback, acupuncture, etc.) vs. a short course of medications for pain treatment if required, utilizing non-narcotics as possible</li>
							<li>Consider course of medications (e.g., <a href="../../../../docs/appendix1/medication/snri/index.html">SNRIs</a>) that may help both depression and neuropathic pain</li>
							<li>Consider initiation of treatment for depression by medications vs referral to Behavioral Health</li>
							<li>Educate about potential adverse effects of opioids for pain (e.g., mood changes) and withdrawal</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Second Steps</h3>
						<p>Reassess for efficacy of initial intervention utilizing the same tools from First Steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Follow up in 1-3 weeks, sooner if clinically indicated</li>
							<li>If chronic narcotics are required, recommend utilization of a pain contract to ensure a single prescribing provider with specialty involvement, both Pain Clinic and Behavioral Health</li>
							<li>Re-examine for possible co-occurring psychological health diagnosis</li>
							<li>As depression treatment improves there is usually a decrease in associated pain symptoms unless there are underlying comorbidities; Thus, both conditions should be aggressively treated</li>
							<li>Referral to psychiatrist, psychologist or case manager may be indicated in cases of significant psychiatric comorbidity</li>
							<li>Minimize adverse effects of pain medications by modifying the dose of medication during titration and/or rotating opioid agent</li>
